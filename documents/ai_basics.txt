Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. 

There are different types of AI: narrow AI, general AI, and superintelligent AI. Narrow AI is designed to perform a narrow task (e.g., only facial recognition or only internet searches or only driving a car). 

General AI would outperform humans at nearly every cognitive task. Superintelligent AI is a hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human minds.

AI is being used in various domains like healthcare, finance, agriculture, and education. It helps in automating repetitive tasks, improving decision-making, and uncovering hidden patterns in large datasets.
